Homozygous reporter mice appear normal and EGFR signaling is intact in vitro and in vivo. We detect distinct patterns of Egfr expression in progenitor and differentiated compartments in embryonic and adult mice. Systemic delivery of EGF or amphiregulin results in markedly different patterns of Egfr internalization and trafficking in hepatocytes. In the normal intestine, Egfr localizes to the crypt rather than villus compartment, expression is higher in adjacent epithelium than in intestinal tumors, and following colonic injury expression appears in distinct cell populations in the stroma. This reporter, under control of its endogenous regulatory elements, enables in vivo monitoring of the dynamics of Egfr localization and trafficking in normal and disease states.

No protein was detectable by immunohistochemical analysis on homozygous mice.,"The COL4A3 gene encodes alpha3 chain of type IV collagen, which is a key component of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and is also the target of pathogenic autoantibodies in human Goodpasture disease (so these are Goodpasture autoantigen-humanized mice). The alpha3(IV) chain forms alpha3alpha4alpha5(IV) heterotrimers which are secreted and incorporated into the GBM. Mutations in the COL4A3, COL4A4 or COL4A5 genes that prevent the assembly of alpha3alpha4alpha5(IV) heterotrimers cause Alport syndrome. Mice expressing a human COL4A3/COL4A4 YAC transgene (""Tg"") mouse line was mated to COL4A3-/- mice (""KO"" mice) and maintained as a Tg/KO line.
The COL4A3/COL4A4 YAC transgenic mice were originally generated by Dr. Laurence Heidet (Pubmed PMID 14507670). Dr. Borza obtained the mice from Dr. Heidet in 2003 on a mixed background. They have been backcrossed for 5 or more generations on the C57BL/6J strain.  The COL4A3/COL4A4 transgenic mouse line (""COL4A3-Tg"") was mated with the Col4a3tm1Jhm mouse line to generate and maintain the Tg/KO mouse line.
The Col4a3tm1Jhm targeted mice were originally generated by Dr. Jeffrey Miner.  Dr. Borza obtained the homozygous Col4a3tm1Jhm, which had been backcrossed on the C57BL/6J background for >15 generations (B6.Col4a3-/-; ""KO""), in 2004.  These B6.Col4a3-/- mice were since maintained by homozygous backcrosses.  The COL4A3/COL4A4 transgenic mouse line (""COL4A3-Tg"") was mated with the Col4a3tm1Jhm mouse line to generate and maintain the Tg/KO mouse line.
Average litter size is about 8 for TgKO mice on the C57BL/6J (B6) background. B6.TgKO mice are viable and fertile and survive beyond than 18 months of age.
In COL4A3/COL4A4 Tg mice, the incorporation of human alpha3(IV) collagen protein in the mouse GBM is significantly reduced in the presence of at least one normal mouse Col4a3 gene (i.e., in Col4a3+/+ or Col4a3+/- mice), but greatly increased in Col4a3-/- Alport mice.
B6.Col4a3-/- mice have a kidney phenotype recapitulating human Alport syndrome and develop progressive kidney disease (initially manifesting as proteinuria) which leads to kidney failure by 6-8 months of age. Expression of human COL4A3/COL4A4 transgene (Tg) on the Col4a3-/- background (KO) restores the expression of alpha3alpha4alpha5(IV) collagen in the glomerular basement membrane and largely rescues the Alport kidney phenotype in TgKO mice. Although proteinuria and abnormal kidney histology (glomerulosclerosis) can be observed after 6 months of age), B6.TgKO mice survive with apparent normal kidney function until 18-24 months of age.
(Note: COL4A3/COL4A4 Tg delays but does not prevent Alport-like kidney disease in Col4a3-/- on the 129 or SJL background, which could provide a model of late-onset Alport syndrome).",Targeted Mutation,Col4a3{tm1Jhm},Insertion,MGI:1934893,Homozygous,8947561,Transgene or BAC Insertion,The transgene was made by modifying YAC clone 870_B6 containing the cDNA of human COL4A3 and Col4A4.

Coronary Vessel Development is Dependent on the Type III Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor. Circulation Research 101: 784-791, 2007.
Generation of null mice:  A targeting vector was made to delete exon 3 that encodes the N-terminus, including a portion of the extracellular ligand binding domain. The genomic structure of Tgfbr3 was determined by searching the Celera database using the published mouse cDNA. Sequence fragments were assembled using DNASTAR software to generate a single, contiguous genomic sequence that spanned all 17 Tgfbr3 exons. Oligonucleotides were designed to PCR amplify 5' and 3' arms of homology and Tgfbr3 exon 3 from 129 SvEvTac mouse genomic DNA. Primers were as follows: Long Arm: Forward 5'GTCGACTTATAAAAGTTTCTGTGAGGA3' Reverse 5'GTCGACGTCAAGGAAACCTCCCAATGG; Short Arm:
Forward 5'CTCGAGTAGTTCCTTATTGAGTTACC3', Reverse 5'CTCGAGACCCTACCTCCTTCTTTCCTATCT3'; exon3:
forward 5'GGATCCACACATAAACCTAAAGAGAAATCA3', Reverse 5'CTCGAGTATTGAAGCATATTACATACGATATGCTTCAATATCCAGGAGCAATGTGTTCT3'. Amplification products were subcloned into pLOX-TKneo after removal of the HSV-TK cassette. The construct was linearized by digestion with NotI (Fig. S1A). ES cells from 129/SvEvTac blastocysts were electroporated with the linearized targeting construct. Seven-hundred G418 resistant clones were screened by Southern blot. One positive clone was expanded and injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts implanted into pseudopregnant female mice. Chimeric mice were mated to C57BL/6J mice and germ line transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed by PCR analysis. 3loxP Tgfbr3 heterozygotes were mated to EIIa-Cre transgenic mice. Progeny were screened by PCR for null alleles produced by Cre mediated recombination. Heterozygous null mice were mated to generate homozygous null mice.

We expect to be able to answer this question by conditionally deleting D111 using pdx I - Cre, ngn3-Cre, and glucagon -Cre and comparing the phenotype of the three. Additionally, by using pdxl-CreERT and ngn3-CreERT and insulin-Cre we also plan to investigate the role of D111 in beta cell development. The global knock-out dies around EIO and is therefore not helpful in this regard. Furthermore, it is possible that Dill serves a later role in pancreatic exocrine development (we detect lacZ in acinar cells of E14.5 DIII+/lacZ heterozygotes) and expect to investigate this by using the elastase-Cre deletor. Again the global knock-out is not usable for this. For these investigations, a targeting vector was constructed for the 0111 gene locus that introduces loxP sites to flank exons 3 and 4. Cre-medlated excition of these exons will result in a null allele as the essential DSL domain will be removed.
